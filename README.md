# GenZpedia
GenZpedia is a crowdsourced, gamified encyclopedia of Gen-Z slang that teaches modern digital language through play, context, and culture. Think: Wikipedia + Duolingo + Urban Dictionary — with emotional intelligence. We don’t just define slang. We explain the tone, intent, emotion, and social meaning behind it.
